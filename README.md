# WhatsApp DualPic Chrome Extension (Prototype)

## Overview  
WhatsApp DualPic is a Chrome Extension prototype that redefines how users express themselves on WhatsApp Web.  
The extension allows uploading two profile pictures and assigning selective visibility rules (e.g., Family, Friends, Work).  

This solves a long-standing UX gap: users want to show different sides of themselvesâ€”professional vs. personalâ€”without compromising privacy.
